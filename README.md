## Installation

```Text
dependencies: [
    // Dependencies declare other packages that this package depends on.
    .package(url: "https://gitlab.com/Pyroh/CoreGeometry.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "4.0.0")),
],
```


## Numeric types additions
### The `째` operator
CoreGeometry adds a new postfixed operator `째` to both `IntegerLiteralType` and `FloatIntegerLiteral`. What it does is to consider the literal as an angle expressed in degrees and convert it in radian.

As a result we can assert that :

```Swift
45째 == CGFloat.pi / 4
90.0째 == CGFloat.pi / 2
```

It helps you to express angles in degree and pass them directly to CoreGraphics functions.
